This project demonstrates an interactive web visualization created with D3.js and Plotly. It reads data from an API and displays demographic information, a horizontal bar chart, and a bubble chart based on user selections from a dropdown menu.

## Usage

To use the interactive web visualization, follow these steps:

1. Use the dropdown menu to select an individual by name.

2. The webpage will display demographic information for the selected individual, including key-value pairs.

3. The horizontal bar chart will display the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found in that individual. Use the chart for data visualization.

4. The bubble chart will display each sample, showing OTU IDs on the x-axis, sample values on the y-axis, and marker size and color corresponding to sample values and OTU IDs, respectively.

5. The charts and demographic information will update whenever a new sample is selected from the dropdown menu.


## Libraries and Technologies Used

- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/): A JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations in the web browser.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/): An open-source graphing library for creating interactive, publication-quality graphs and charts.
